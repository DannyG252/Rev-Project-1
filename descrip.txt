STEPS
****
(point out error codes for bad retirevals, ect)

-create user -> show in database
-login - employee
	-show invalid login
	-show cookie
-submit ticket
-get employee's prev ticket ids for current employee
	-show bad retrieval 
-(choose 1) get ticket by id
	-show invalid ticket [ex.id:22]
-Process ticket - show no authorization


-login as manager
	-show cookie changed
-process ticket
	-show already processed one [ticket id: 1]
-get that ticket by id (show that is processed)

//maybe show logging at end

---
-manager can view all tickets and pending -> show all pending ; manager only
-employee view prev -> employee only, gets employee id from cookie

-process ticket automatically takes manager id & uses that for ticket
-submit ticket -> auto grab employee id
